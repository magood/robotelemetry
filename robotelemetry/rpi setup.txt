requirements on the raspberry pi:

-gpsd
-redis
-serial config to enable the hardware uart and not run a console on the dumb thing
-supervisor

pip installs (eventually these should be in requirements.txt):
flask
flask-socketio
redis
gpsd-py3
numpy
eventlet

deprecated?
pynmea

I intended to make a nice CLI with click (installed as part of flask) but haven't gotten there yet.
